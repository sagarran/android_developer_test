# Mynigma - README

In order to see how you work we would love to see how you develop a couple
of little code projects. 

We are looking for a full-stack Android developer, who will develop our
Android app, so the tasks will cover some backend code as well as some UI
changes, but should only take a few hours.

We will discuss the assignment in the interview. It would be great to also
see test coverage results for the tasks.


#### Submitting your application

 - Please perform both assignments
 - Create a branch of your name and which task you performed (A1 or A2) and
push to your forked repository.
 - Create a pull request to master from your repository.


### Assignment 1

Ancient Roman numbers have a unique characteristic. Most numbers can be
expressed in more than one way, which is inefficient and can be confusing. As if they were designed by Microsoft ;).

Examples:  
 - 9 can be IX or VIIII  
 - 99 can be IC or XCIX  

Write a program in Java to convert a given Roman numeral to the most
efficient format (Roman numeral with smallest string length).

Some of the crazy numbers are as follows: 

  	MMMMCXXXIII
  	CLXX
  	DCCCXVIII
  	MLXVII
  	DLXXXX
  	MMDXXI
  	MMMMDLXXXXVIII
  	MXXII  


### Assignment 2

Develop a small Android app that allows the user to convert Celcius to
Fahrenheit. 

The application should display the two temperatures visually. Make sure the
design will allow for adding more functionality later, such as doing other
kinds of conversions.


Have fun :)
